Project scope: 
Construct a presentation website for a Fictive Pension. Besides accomodation the pension offers various experiences depending on the outside weather. 
The website must have a reservation form in the footer consiting of: fullName, check-in, check-out, number of people and a checkbox whether or not the client has childrens.

User story: as Experience Manager of the Fictive Pension I want to assign to new reservations various services. Depending on the current outside weather assign an extra service to the reservation like so: If the weather is cloudy assign the service "Indoor lessons" otherwise "Trekking in the forest".  

Bonus point:
- depending on the same weather variable, display the landing page in two modes: Sunny Day or Cloudy.

Requirements:
- The reservations must persist in data storage and a schema must be provided. 
- You can use Bootstrap but no JS frameworks, just vanilla JS.
